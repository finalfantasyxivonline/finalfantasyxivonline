<br><br><b> im a bit trigger-happy with the hide button, if im covering someone its very likely not intentional
<br><br><b> my main fandoms are splatoon, homestuck, final fantasy xiv, yume nikki + its many fangames, etc etc... seriously, theres way too many to list here. you should ask me about them! *wink!\*
