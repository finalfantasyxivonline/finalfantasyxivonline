<p><i>"In one fleeting moment, lives come and go. Ever moving towards the unknown.</p>
<p>And in that fleeting moment, they cry for the answer to the question:</p>
<p>Why, given life, are they meant to suffer. To die...</p>
<p>As fragmented, imperfect beings, yours is a never-ending quest.</p>
<p>A quest to find your purpose, knowing your end is assured.</p>
<p>To find the strength to continue, when all strength has left you.</p>
<p>To find joy, even as darkness descends...</p>
<p>...And amidst deepest despair, light everlasting."</i></p>
